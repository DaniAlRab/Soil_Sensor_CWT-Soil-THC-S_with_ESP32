# Soil_Sensor_CWT-Soil-THC-S_with_ESP32
"This small project utilizes an ESP32 and an RS-485 soil sensor to communicate via a serial port and read data transmitted using the Modbus protocol. The sensor provides valuable information about the soil, including 'Humidity,' 'Temperature,' 'Conductivity,' 'Salinity,' and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)."
